3: Display the message “My name is your_name. I am X years old”.

variable and use that variable to display your age in the place of “X” in the
message.)

4: Find the division of two numbers and display the message:
“Value after division is: division_value”. Take all inputs from user and also display
the data type of all the variables used. (“division_value” should be replaced with
the actual value obtained after division.)

two numbers and finding the actual value, Divide the two numbers and only
display the integer part of the value obtained.

inside the print() to display the message. (sum_value should be replaced with the
sum value obtained.)
